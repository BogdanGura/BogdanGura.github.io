          Hi, my name is Bogdan Gura and I recently graduated from my local highschool and trade school.
          When I was younger I was always around some kind of device and one day I was thinking which career would be the best fit for me.
          After some pondering I found out that I have deep interest in the field of Computer Science since we live in a digital age and a lot of cool tech comes from the IT sector.
          Another reason would also be that you can work remotely which I appreciate since you can be anywhere and still work as long as you have internet access.
          As for my spare time when I'm not coding I'm usually really into fitness and weight lifting.
          Now I'm preparing to go into Kent State University in August to pursue my major in Emerging Media and Technology which I'm really excited about.
